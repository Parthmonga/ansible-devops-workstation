# Ansible Playbook - Linux DevOps Workstation

This playbook installs and configures almost everything I need in order to build a Linux cloud DevOps development workstation.  

Although this is a work in progress, the idea is that it is supposed to be able to run on the most recent version of distros based on both RHEL and Ubuntu.
